# California Mystery Gas Surcharge Project 

This project is an attempt to replicate the methodology of Severin Borenstein's 
calculations for California's Mystery Gasoline Surcharge, a description of which 
can be found [here](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/borenste/MysterySurchargeCalculation2019May.pdf).
The Mystery Gas Surcharge is the unexplained difference between the retail price
of gasoline in California and the rest of the United State. This unexplained 
difference is the difference in retail price, *beyond* the difference in taxes 
and fees between California and the rest of the country.
